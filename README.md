# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

College studio is a college finding web app created by Mickey Lema, Kyra Bautista, Lauren Smith, and Tyler Van Brocklin.
With this app, users can search potential schools based on school name or school state.

# About the Project

Users can discover schools this way whether or not they have created an account.
A user can create an account using the Sign In tab, where they can enter their
name, email, and a password to be able to create a new account. Once an account has
been made, the user can sign in or out using this login information whenever they want.
Once logged in, a user has the ability to add and remove a college to their favorites
list directly from viewing that college's card and clicking on the Favorite or Delete
button on the bottom of the card. Additionally, upon logging out and back in, user's
preferred tuition value is saved in the search sidebar on the Find page.
