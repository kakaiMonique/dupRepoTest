College studio is a college finding web app created by Mickey Lema and Kyra Bautista.
With this app, users can search potential schools based on school name or school state.

Due to the differences in projects (a illustration web app and a college finding app) 
it was difficult for us to combine both stages 2 projects together. 
Additionally, the canvas tag required in the Illustration app was not readily responsive, making it a difficult project to begin with. 

To make up for this we decided to change the layout and build vertically similar to the layout in the Illustration app. 

We also changed the interactivity of the search input. Before, submitting a search query required an exact match with a school name to get results, however, the added interactive feature now allows users to render live results as they write partial or full school names. Users can also search school based on state, giving more flexibility options to loop for schools.

The idea behind this was to render new features based on user interaction (just like the prompt generator in the Illustration wepp app).
